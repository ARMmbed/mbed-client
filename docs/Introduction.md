# ARM mbed Client overview

ARM mbed Client is a library that provides the means to connect constrained embedded devices to mbed Device Connector Service, mbed Device Server and to mbed-enabled cloud services from our partners.

The mbed Client high-level APIs allow mbed OS developers to create applications with LWM2M features as described in the [Lightweight Machine to Machine Technical Specification](http://technical.openmobilealliance.org/Technical/technical-information/release-program/current-releases/oma-lightweightm2m-v1-0):

- Manage devices on mbed Device Server.
- Securely communicate with internet services over the industry standard TLS/DTLS.
- Fully control the endpoint and application logic. 

The API is written in C++ to allow quick application development.

## Managing devices on mbed Device Server

mbed Client supports the following three features introduced in the subsequent chapters:

- [Client Registration and Deregistration](client_reg_dereg.md)
- [Device Management and Service Enablement](dev_man_serv_enable.md)
- [Information Reporting](info_reporting.md)

The API also provides an interface to define the application endpoint information. This information will be delivered to mbed Device Server during the registration operation.

First, you need to create an interface for mbed Client:

```
#include "mbed-client/m2minterfacefactory.h"
#include "mbed-client/m2minterface.h"

M2MInterface* interface = M2MInterfaceFactory::create_interface(*this,
                                                  "mbed-endpoint",
                                                  "test",
                                                  3600,
                                                  5684,
                                                  "",
                                                  M2MInterface::UDP,
                                                  M2MInterface::LwIP_IPv4,
                                                  "");
```

### Setting up own random number generator function

To provide a stronger security mechanism, mbed Client requires a random number generator to feed a random number into the underlying SSL library. There is a default PRNG seeded with RTC for security but some platforms do not have RTC, and for some, time value seeded PRNG is not secure enough. 

Now, an application can pass its own RNG implementation to mbed Client as function pointer callback through an API, `set_random_number_callback(random_number_cb callback)`.

Here is an example on how you can use it from an application:

```
#include "mbed-client/m2minterfacefactory.h"
#include "mbed-client/m2minterface.h"

uint32_t get_random_number(void)
{
    uint32_t i = 0;
    printf("\Your application's RNG logic\n");
    return i;
}

_interface->set_random_number_callback(&get_random_number);

```

### Setting up own entropy function for additional secure connectivity 

mbed Client provides an API to add your own entropy source into the underlying SSL library.

Now, an application can pass its own entropy source to mbed Client as function pointer callback through an API  `set_entropy_callback(entropy_cb callback)`.

Here is an example on how you can use it from an application:

```
#include "mbed-client/m2minterfacefactory.h"
#include "mbed-client/m2minterface.h"

entropy_cb ent_cb;

int ent_poll( void *, unsigned char *output, size_t len,
                           size_t *olen )
{
    // Customer provided entropy implementation
    return( 0 );
}

    ent_cb.entropy_source_ptr = ent_poll;
    ent_cb.p_source = NULL;
    ent_cb.threshold = 128;
    ent_cb.strong = 0;

_interface->set_entropy_callback(ent_cb);

```

### Maximum UDP message size

The maximum single UDP message size that mbed Client can receive is 1152 bytes. The actual payload size is 1137 bytes, the header information using the remaining 15 bytes. 

For transferring larger amounts of data, the Blockwise feature must be deployed. When using this feature, mbed Client can handle messages up to 65KB by default. This feature is disabled by default. To receive more than 65KB, see [Setting an external handler for block-wise messages](Howto.md#setting-an-external-handler-for-block-wise-messages).

To enable the Blockwise feature in mbed OS, create a `mbed_app.json` file in the application level and overwrite Blockwise value as described below:

*Example:*
```
"target_overrides": {
        "*": {
            "mbed-client.sn-coap-max-blockwise-payload-size": 1024
        }

```

To enable the Blockwise feature in yotta based builds, you need to create a `config.json` file in the application level. 

*Example:*
```
{
"coap_max_blockwise_payload_size": 1024
}
```

Acceptable values for the `coap_max_blockwise_payload_size` flag are:
0, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512 and 1024. Value 0 means that the feature is not used.

### CoAP message deduplication

By default, message deduplication is disabled. More information about deduplication in the [CoAP specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252#page-24).

For mbed OS, to enable message deduplication, create a `mbed_app.json` file in the application level and overwrite the deduplication value as described below:

*Example:*
```
"target_overrides": {
        "*": {
            "mbed-client.sn-coap-duplication-max-msgs-count": 1
        }

```
For yotta based builds, to enable message deduplication, you need to create a `config.json` file in the application level.

*Example:*
```
{
"coap_duplication_max_msgs_count": 1
}
```
Recommended values for the `coap_duplication_max_msgs_count` flag are 0 to 6. Value 0 means that the feature is not used. It is not recommended to use higher value than 6, because it increases the memory consumption.

### Reconnectivity

Apart from standard CoAP features, mbed Client also handles reconnectivity logic on behalf of applications, thereby aiming to provide seamless connectivity experience and recovery from temporary network hiccups or service side disruptions.

The reconnection logic handles the following:

 - Reconnection towards mDS; establishing the network connection and re-registration to mDS.
 - CoAP message resending logic. More information about resending in [CoAP specification](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7252#section-4.8).

There are two parameters in the reconnection logic, both configurable by the application:

 - Reconnection Retry
 - Reconnection Time Interval (in seconds)

mbed Client tries to establish a successful connection to the server by incrementing the reconnection trials every time there is a failed connection attempt. 

The logic of the `Reconnection Timeout` is `Reconnection Retry count * Reconnection Time Interval` , where `Reconnection Retry count` is incremented by 1 with every failed reconnection attempt.

mbed Client continues to attempt a reconnection until `Reconnection Retry count` reaches the defined value (either by the application or the default value set in Client).

If mbed Client still cannot establish a connection and the set `Reconnection Retry count` is reached, it returns an error through a callback with an appropriate error code defining the reason for failed connection.

There are a few exceptions to the reconnection logic though. If mbed Client sends registration data that is rejected by the server, the client returns an error and does not attempt a reconnection as the server has rejected the data from the client. A typical example of such case would be passing a non-matching endpoint name or domain name against the client certificates.

Applications can define their own parameters for the reconnection logic.

For mbed OS, to overwrite the reconnection retry count and reconnection time interval, create a `mbed_app.json` file in the application level and overwrite the values as described below:

*Example:*
```
"target_overrides": {
        "*": {
            "mbed-client.reconnection-count": 3,
            "mbed-client.reconnection-interval": 5,
        }

```
For yotta  based builds, to overwrite the reconnection retry count and reconnection time interval, you need to create a `config.json` file in the application level.

*Example:*
```
{
"reconnection_count": 3,
"reconnection_interval": 5
}
```
