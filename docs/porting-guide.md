# mbed Client structure and build process

<span style="background-color:#E6E6E6;border:1px solid #000;display:block; height:100%; padding:10px">**Tip:** Before embarking on your own port, you should build the core mbed Client for an existing compilation target to get an understanding of how the mbed Client builds.</span>

mbed Client is structured as a set of modules. Each module declares which other modules it depends on. When you build a module, our build system `yotta` looks at these dependencies and installs the necessary modules before completing the build.

This is also the process to build applications for the mbed Client (including the example application in the release). The application declares dependencies on the mbed Client and when it is built, `yotta` ensures that the modules (and anything that they depend on, recursively) are present before building. 

In general, `yotta` downloads and installs the necessary modules over the internet from the public yotta Registry (which saves published versions of modules) or from a specified source control URL.

# Components of mbed Client

## Component software modules

mbed Client consists of one main component. More major components will be added in future development phases:

 * `mbed-client` is the core mbed Client, providing C++ APIs for the mbed Client.

This module depends on further internal modules:

```
mbed-client x.x.x
|
|_mbed-client-c x.x.x
|   |_mbed-client-libservice x.x.x
|
|_mbed-client-linux x.x.x
```

To list the dependency trees, use the [`yotta list --all` command](http://docs.yottabuild.org/reference/commands.html).

<span style="background-color:#E6E6E6;  border:1px solid #000;display:block; height:100%; padding:10px">**Note**: In this case, we have listed the dependencies for the `x86-linux-native` compilation target. Different modules are needed for different compilation targets.</span>

We are using the [mbed Client Linux example](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-linux-example) in this document. You can see that it depends directly only on the `mbed-client` and `mbed-client-linux` modules. These modules depend internally on various other modules.

```
mbed-client-linux-example x.x.x
|
|_mbed-client x.x.x
   |
   |_mbed-client-c x.x.x
   |   |_mbed-client-libservice x.x.x
   |
   |_mbed-client-linux 0.0.2
```

## Compilation targets

To compile for a target board, you need a [target description](http://docs.yottabuild.org/tutorial/targets.html) that describes how to compile for the target. 

The `mbed-client` module uses the platform name that each target defines to choose which `mbed-client-<platform-name>` module to depend on to provide the platform-specific implementation.

# Porting mbed Client to a different platform

To port mbed Client to a new platform:

 1. [Request for a development repository](#requesting-for-a-development-repository).
 2. [Create a yotta compilation target for your board](#creating-a-yotta-compilation-target).
 3. [Implement the `mbed-client-xxx` module for your target platform](#implementing-mbed-client-xxx).
 4. [Modify the `module.json` of the `mbed-client` module](#modifying-the-json-file-in-the-mbed-client-module).
 5. [Verify that your implementation is correct](#testing-and-verification).

The `yotta` build system is designed for easy reuse of generic modules. If you intend to support multiple platforms that share common features, we recommend moving the common functionality into a separate module and use it for each platform.

## Requesting for a development repository

We provide private git repositories to our partners porting mbed Client. Only the members of the mbed Client team and relevant partner contacts and engineers have access to these repositories.

When you contact `support@mbed.org`, a repository will be created for your module. You also need to provide the target description of your board as follows:

- **`mbed-client-<platform-name>`** is the module that provides the `mbed-client-xxx` implementation for your platform. You may choose to split it into further modules in the future, to enable sharing of code, but we recommend that you implement the port for your first board in this module itself. 

- **`target-<targetname>`** contains the yotta target description of the target you are porting to. This is usually your platform name.

## Creating a yotta compilation target

An example on compiling for linux target can be found in the `yotta_targets` directory of [the example application] (https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-linux-example).

Please, refer to the [yotta documentation](http://yottadocs.mbed.com/tutorial/targets.html) for setting up your compilation target.

1.To make your target available locally (without publishing it), you use the `yotta link-target` command to link it into the global install targets directory:

```
# in the directory of your target:
yotta link-target
```

2.Use `yotta link-target <targetname>` command to make the globally linked target available when compiling another module.

3.Use the `yotta target <targetname>` command to select your target for the compilation.

## Implementing mbed-client-xxx

Clone your `mbed-client-<your-platform-name>` module and `mbed-client` modules from GitHub.

The `mbed-client-<your-platform-name>` module needs to provide a socket and timer implementation for your target platform. The `mbed-client-xxx` module should include files `m2mconnectionhandler.h`and `m2mtimer.h` from `mbed-client` and implement a corresponding `.cpp` file that points to the platform-specific private implementations of the timer and the socket.

<span style="background-color:#E6E6E6;  border:1px solid #000;display:block; height:100%; padding:10px">**Note**: Private implementation classes **must** be named as `M2MConnectionHandlerPimpl` and `M2MTimerPimpl`, because of forward declarations.</span>

An example of mbed-client-platform:

```
|_module.json
|
|_mbed-client-platform
|    |_m2mconnectionhandlerpimpl.h
|    |_m2mtimerpimpl.h
|
|_source
    |_m2mconnectionhandler.cpp
    |_m2mconnectionhandlerpimpl.cpp
    |_m2mtimer.cpp
    |_m2mtimerpimpl.cpp
```

To make your module available to other modules that you want to build, you need to use the [`yotta link`](http://docs.yottabuild.org/reference/commands.html#yotta-link) command to link it to the module where you want to test it out.

For example, to use your local your in-development mbed-client implementation, use the command `yotta link mbed-client-xxx` in the main `mbed-client` module.

```
# in mbed-client, link your module:
yotta link mbed-client-xxx
```

You can also just commit and push your untested code to GitHub, but it is always a good idea to test before committing.

Your `mbed-client-xxx` module must provide a platform-specific implementation for the mbed-client. The APIs that need porting are defined in the `mbed-client-linux` module. The header files contain documentation alongside the declaration of each function, where the function is described along with its parameters and return value.

There are two header files that require porting for your platform:

- `m2mconnectionhandler.h`
- `m2mtimer.h` 

To see how this is done in Linux, check the `mbed-client-linux` module from the mbed [Client Linux Example](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-linux-example).

Please note that some of these functions are asynchronous in nature and some are expecting a callback from the network.

The callback comes through the Observer class defined in `M2MConnectionObserver`.

The file `m2mconnectionobserver.h` is present in `mbed-client`. To see how the callback needs to be called, check the implementation in `m2mconnectionhandlerpimpl.cpp` in  `mbed-client-linux`.

The timer API functions are asynchronous in nature and whenever a timer event is available, `mbed-client` is notified, so that the library can act on the _timer expired_ signal. The callback is received through an Observer class defined in `M2MTimerObserver` .

The file `m2mtimerobserver.h` is present in `mbed-client`. To see how the callback needs to be called, check the implementation in `m2mtimerimpl.cpp` in `mbed-client-linux`.

## Modifying the `json` file in the `mbed-client` module

You need to add your target name to `module.json` so that when you set `yt target <platform>`, yotta can resolve the dependency correctly and link the main library with your module.

Two platforms, mbed OS and Linux, are already supported. You just need to add your module support after that.

    },
  }
}
```

## Testing and verification

You can build your mbed-client port immediately:

```
# use the target we previously made locally available (not necessary if your target has been published):
yotta link-target <yourtargetname>
# build!
yotta build
```

A `helloworld-mbedclient` program will be produced inside the `build/<yourtargetname>/test/` directory. This test application may require some changes to compile and run for your platform. Check for compilation errors. If you find any, fix the test application for your testing. 

Follow the `readme` [instructions](https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-client-linux-example) of the `mbed-client-linux` example to see what the test application can do.
